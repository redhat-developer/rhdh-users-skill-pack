# Workflow: Help

Explain the upgrade-helper skill to the user. No data sources needed.

## Response

**upgrade-helper** analyzes your RHDH configuration against a target release and produces a personalized migration plan — showing exactly what affects your setup and what doesn't.

### What it does

1. **Scans for secrets** — checks config files for embedded API keys, passwords, and tokens before processing
2. **Analyzes your environment** — reads your config files or asks about your setup to understand your plugins, auth providers, SCM, and features
3. **Resolves OCI references** — looks up each plugin in your config against the overlay repo workspace metadata to determine if local-path references need OCI migration
4. **Validates existing OCI plugins** — checks that your `oci://` references are still valid and up-to-date for the target release
5. **Checks release notes** — reads bundled release notes (1.4–1.10) for breaking changes, deprecated features, removed features, and known issues
6. **Searches for known bugs** — queries RHDHBUGS Jira per-plugin for open bugs affecting your specific plugin versions, plus GitHub Issues for community-reported upgrade issues
7. **Filters what affects YOU** — classifies every breaking change as "Affects You" or "Does NOT Affect You" based on your actual configuration
8. **Generates a migration plan** — prioritized by severity (Critical → fix before upgrade, Important → fix after, Informational → nice to know)
9. **Computes a Readiness Score** — 0-100 score with transparent breakdown showing every deduction
10. **Recommends RHDH Local** — suggests testing your updated configuration locally before deploying to your cluster

### How to invoke

**With a config file (recommended for repeat use):**
Create a `.upgrade-helper.yaml` in your working directory:
```yaml
from: "1.8"
to: "1.10"
configs:
  - ./values.yaml
  - ./app-config-custom.yaml
  - ./dynamic-plugins-override.yaml
```
Then run:
```
/upgrade-helper
```
The skill reads file paths and release versions from this file. No flags needed.

**With individual files:**
```
/upgrade-helper --to 1.10 --config ./values.yaml --config ./app-config.yaml
```
`--config` can be specified multiple times. File type is auto-detected from content.

**With a config directory:**
```
/upgrade-helper --to 1.10 --config-path ./my-configs/
```
Scans the directory for known file patterns (`values*.yaml`, `app-config*.yaml`, `dynamic-plugins*.yaml`, `.env`).

**With an rhdh-local project:**
```
/upgrade-helper --to 1.10 --config-path ./rhdh-local/
```
Auto-detects the rhdh-local project structure, discovers all configs in `configs/app-config/` and `configs/dynamic-plugins/`, reads the current version from `compose.yaml` / `.env`, and merges multiple app-config files automatically.

**Interactive (no config files):**
```
/upgrade-helper --to 1.10
```
Asks your current version, deployment method, then asks for config file paths. If you don't have files, falls back to manual questions about auth, SCM, and features.

**Skip-release upgrade:**
```
/upgrade-helper --to 1.10 --from 1.8
```
Surfaces all breaking changes across skipped releases (1.9 and 1.10 in this example).

### Arguments

| Argument | Required | Description |
|----------|----------|-------------|
| `--to X.Y` | Yes | Target RHDH version to upgrade TO |
| `--from X.Y` | No | Source RHDH version upgrading FROM. Defaults to the release immediately before `--to` |
| `--config /path/to/file` | No | Individual config file path. Repeatable |
| `--config-path /dir` | No | Directory to scan for config files |

All arguments can also be set in `.upgrade-helper.yaml` — CLI args override the config file.

### What config files to provide

The skill accepts any combination of these files. File type is auto-detected from content, not filename:

| File type | Content markers | What it provides |
|-----------|----------------|------------------|
| **Helm values** | `global.dynamic.plugins`, `upstream.backstage` | Plugins, auth, SCM, catalog providers (all-in-one) |
| **App-config** | Root-level `auth:`, `catalog:`, `backend:`, `proxy:` | Auth providers, catalog providers, integrations |
| **Dynamic plugins config** | Top-level `plugins:` array with `package:` entries | Plugin list, OCI references, pluginConfig |
| **Backstage CR** | `kind: Backstage`, `apiVersion: rhdh.redhat.com` | Deployment method (Operator), referenced ConfigMaps |
| **Compose file** | `services:` with `image:` containing `rhdh` | RHDH version (auto-detected from image tag) |
| **Environment file** | `KEY=VALUE` pairs | Env var overrides, proxy settings, NFS config |

For **Helm deployments**, `values.yaml` is usually sufficient — it contains plugins, auth, and app-config embedded. If you have separate `app-config` or `dynamic-plugins` ConfigMaps, provide those too.

For **Operator deployments**, provide the Backstage CR plus the `app-config` and `dynamic-plugins` ConfigMap contents as separate files.

For **rhdh-local**, just point `--config-path` at the rhdh-local directory — everything is discovered automatically.

### What the report includes

1. **Critical findings** — must fix before upgrading (OCI-only plugins, removed plugins, hard breaks)
2. **Important findings** — address before or soon after upgrading (local-path → OCI migration, outdated OCI tags)
3. **Informational** — awareness items, new features available
4. **Does NOT Affect You** — breaking changes with no overlap to your config (reduces upgrade anxiety)
5. **Known Issues Affecting Your Plugins** — open bugs from RHDHBUGS Jira matching your specific plugin versions, with workarounds
6. **Plugin version table** — every plugin in your config with its version, artifact type, and support level from workspace metadata
7. **Environment summary** — what was detected from your config files
8. **Readiness Score breakdown** — every deduction traced to a specific finding
9. **Pre-upgrade testing with RHDH Local** — recommendation and setup instructions
10. **Upgrade checklist** — actionable pre/during/post steps

### Security

- All input files are scanned for embedded secrets before processing
- Template variable references (`${MY_SECRET}`, `{{ .Values.x }}`) are safe — only literal values are flagged
- If secrets are detected, you're warned and asked to continue or redact first
- Detected secrets are replaced with `[REDACTED]` in all report output
- The skill does not modify, store, or transmit your configuration files

### What it does NOT do

- Does not modify your files — read-only analysis
- Does not predict issues from ticket history
- Does not verify runtime behavior — test with RHDH Local for that
- Does not construct OCI references that don't exist in workspace metadata — only recommends what's verified

### Prerequisites

| Dependency | Required | Purpose | If unavailable |
|------------|----------|---------|----------------|
| `git` | Yes | Shallow clone of overlay repo for plugin metadata | Falls back to `gh api` calls (slower, rate-limited) |
| `gh` CLI (authenticated) | Recommended | GitHub Issues search, fallback for overlay repo | Bug search skipped; overlay repo needs `git` |
| Atlassian MCP (Jira) | Optional | Per-plugin bug search against RHDHBUGS | Skipped silently — report uses release notes + GitHub Issues only |
| `lynx` | Optional | Auto-fetch missing release notes | Notes the gap with a link to official docs |

The skill degrades gracefully — each dependency adds depth to the report, but the core analysis (config parsing, OCI resolution from local clone, release notes, readiness scoring) works with just `git`.

### Bundled release notes

Includes RHDH 1.4 through 1.10. Missing versions auto-fetched via `lynx` if available.
