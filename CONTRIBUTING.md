# Contributing to RHDH Users Skill Pack

Thank you for helping improve Agent Skills for Red Hat Developer Hub users.

This project uses the Apache-2.0 License.

## What belongs in this repository

This pack is for platform users. Its skills help users adopt, operate, and get value from Red Hat Developer Hub. RHDH Engineering team workflows (Jira automation, release and CI tooling) belong in [`redhat-developer/rhdh-skill`](https://github.com/redhat-developer/rhdh-skill).

## Get started

```bash
git clone https://github.com/redhat-developer/rhdh-users-skill-pack.git
cd rhdh-users-skill-pack
uv sync --extra dev
git config core.hooksPath .githooks
```

The `core.hooksPath` setting enables the checked-in pre-commit hook (lint and tests). You do not need a separate `pre-commit install` step.

### Run tests

```bash
uv run pytest
```

### Lint

```bash
uv run ruff check .
uv run ruff format --check .
```

Both run automatically via the pre-commit hook when `pre-commit` is installed.

## Adding or changing a skill

1. Follow the [Agent Skills specification](https://agentskills.io/specification).
2. Place the skill at `skills/<name>/` where `<name>` matches the `name` field in `SKILL.md` front matter.
3. Keep `SKILL.md` focused. Put detailed guidance in `references/`, scripts in `scripts/`, and examples in `assets/`.
4. Prefer stdlib-only Python for bundled scripts unless a dependency is clearly justified.
5. Update the skills table in [README.md](./README.md) when you add a new skill.
6. Add or update tests under `tests/` when you change scripts or validation logic.

Use the bundled `skill-maker` skill to interview, draft, and audit new skills before you open a PR.

## Submitting a pull request

1. Fork the repository and create a branch from `main`.
2. Make focused commits. One concern per commit is practical.
3. Confirm `uv run pytest` and `uv run ruff check .` pass.
4. Open a pull request with:
   - the user problem the change solves.
   - how you tested it.
   - any new prerequisites users should know about.

## Reporting issues

Report issues against this repository in [JIRA](https://issues.redhat.com/browse/RHIDP). Include your RHDH version, agent tool, and the prompt or task that did not work as expected.

## CLAUDE.md

`CLAUDE.md` contains `@AGENTS.md`, a directive that points Claude Code to the canonical file. Edit `AGENTS.md`, not `CLAUDE.md`.
